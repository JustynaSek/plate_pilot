### Using pip (Traditional Method)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash

cd PlatePilot
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash

# On macOS/Linux
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download the vector database:
```bash
# Install gdown if not already installed
pip install gdown

# Download the vector database
gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1E0D8l_RSFrv37QZvam9fiYpA8HQoVRIU

# Extract the database
# On Windows
tar -xf vector_db.tar.gz -C data_processing/

# On macOS/Linux
tar -xzf vector_db.tar.gz -C data_processing/
```

### Using uv (Faster Alternative)

.\venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install dependencies using uv:
```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Download the vector database:
```bash
# Install gdown if not already installed
pip install gdown

# Download the vector database
gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1E0D8l_RSFrv37QZvam9fiYpA8HQoVRIU

# Extract the database
# On Windows
tar -xf vector_db.tar.gz -C data_processing/

# On macOS/Linux
tar -xzf vector_db.tar.gz -C data_processing/
```

## Configuration

```bash
# On Windows
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here


# On macOS/Linux
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```
